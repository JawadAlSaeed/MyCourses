    "* A git client is used by developers to track code changes locally\n",
    "* A git client is used to communicate code changes with a Git server such as ```github.com```\n",
    "* Allows you to manage code changes and collborate with outher people who make code changes\n",
    "* Allows each developer to have their own local version of a project during development\n",
    "* Individual versions of the code can be branched and merged with the main version of the project\n",
    "* Allows you to go back to a specific version of tracked files at any given point in time\n",
    "* Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 to manage open-source Linux kernel development\n",

    "\n",
    "* A Git **repository** is a container for a project that is tracked by Git\n",
    "* Two major types of Git repositories:\n",
    "    - **local repository** is a private repository stored on your local computer\n",
    "    - **remote repository** is a repository stored on a shared access remote server (e.g. github.com)\n",
    "* **working directory** is where you work on making changes to your source code\n",
    "* **staging area** (a.k.a. **index**) contains files to be a part of the next commit\n",
    "* **snapshot** is the state of your code at a specific point in time\n",
    "* **commit** commits a checkpoint (snapshot) of your project state from staging to local repository\n",
    "* **branch** is an active line of development\n",
    "* **tip** is the most recent commit on a branch\n",
    "* **HEAD** is the tip of the current branch\n",
    "* **master** is the main development branch\n",
    "* **origin** is the default upstream repository\n",
    "* **push** updates the remote repository from local repository\n",
    "* **clone** clones a repository from remote repository into a new local directory"
