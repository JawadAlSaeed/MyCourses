    "## JavaScript Background\n",
    "* JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995\n",
    "* JavaScript is a trademark currently owned by Oracle (previously owned by Sun)\n",
    "* JavaScript is the common name of the programming language\n",
    "* ECMAScript is the name used by the language specification standard\n",
    "* Supports dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## JavaScript Everywhere\n",
    "* Client-side web (virtually all web browsers)\n",
    "* Server-side web (NodeJS, along with Express.js, etc.)\n",
    "* Embedded mobile device app frameworks: Electron, Cordova, NativeScript, etc.\n",
    "* Dev toolchain (NodeJS, along with VisualStudio Code, Babel, Webpack, etc.)\n",
    "* Database scripting environments (MongoDB, CouchDB, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## JavaScript APIs, Libraries, and Frameworks\n",
    "* Browser APIs: File, IndexedDB, Web Audio, Web Sockets, WebGL, Web Storage, Web Workers, Canvas, etc.\n",
    "* Node APIs: HTTP, REST, MongoDB, socket.io, axios, etc.\n",
    "* Client-side libraries and frameworks: Angular, React.js, Vue.js, etc.\n",
    "* Server-side libraries and frameworks: Node.js, Express.js, etc.\n",

    "## JavaScript Runtime Environment\n",
    "* JavaScript code is just text that is interpreted dynamically at runtime like Python\n",
    "* JavaScript is not compiled into native binary code prior to execution like C++\n",
    "* JavaScript engine implements (some version of) the standard ECMAScript language specification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of JavaScript Engines\n",
    "* Chrome V8 – Google Chrome, Opera, NodeJS, and Couchbase\n",
    "* SpiderMonkey – Mozilla Firefox\n",
    "* Nitro – Apple Safari\n",
    "* Chakra – Microsoft Edge\n",
    "\n",
    "## JavaScript is Single Threaded\n",
    "* JavaScript engine instance runs all JavaScript code in a single thread\n",
    "* Single threaded event loop dispatches events in the event queue to handler functions (callbacks)\n",
    "* When a callback function runs, it blocks others from running.\n",
    "* No context switching, all callbacks in event queue must wait to be dispatched\n"
