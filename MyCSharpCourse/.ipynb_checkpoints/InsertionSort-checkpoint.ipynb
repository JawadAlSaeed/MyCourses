    "# Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting is done by iterating up through the array, growing the sorted list behind it. At each position, it checks the value there against the previous position. If larger, it leaves the element in place and moves to the next. If smaller, it searches in reverse through the sorted part of the array to find the correct position within the sorted list. As it does this, elements are swapped so that all larger values are shifted to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very simple\n",
    "* Very efficient for very small data sets\n",
    "* More efficient than other $O(n^2)$ algorithms (selection sort, bubble sort)\n",
    "* Efficient for data sets that are already mostly sorted\n",
    "* Stable (does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys)\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion Sort is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Space Complexity: $O(1)$\n",
    "* Time Complexity: $O(n)$, $O(n^2)$, $O(n^2)$ for Best, Average and Worst cases respectively."
